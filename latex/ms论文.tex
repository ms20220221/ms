\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Background}
As personal assets accumulate, more and more people are entering the investment market in order to preserve the value of their existing assets or to make them more valuable.
However, we all know that investment products are often highly volatile,in orther words, it is difficult to predict.
Among the many investment products, gold and bitcoin are the most popular.
Bitcoin, in particular, has seen a rapid expansion in trading since its emergence.But its security and stability have been called into question by the huge price fluctuations.

Obviously, with the gold and bitcoin investment boom, a substantially profitable portfolio for the average trader is difficult to achieve.
It is essential to predict future trends in volatile assets based on daily and previous days' updated trading data.
Therefore, traders propose to develop a model that uses only the past stream of daily prices 
to date to determine each day if the trader should buy, hold, or sell their assets in their portfolio.
随着个人资产的累计，越来越多的人进入投资市场，为了在使现有资产保值或更有价值。
但我们都知道，投资类产品常有很强的波动性，这意味着它很难预测。
在众多投资产品中，黄金和比特币最受人关注。
特别是比特币，自出现以来交易规模迅速扩张,但巨大的价格波动使其安全性和稳定性受到质疑。
那么，在黄金和比特币投资热潮下，对普通交易者大幅度得利的投资组合很难实现。
这是很重要的，根据每天和前几天更新的交易数据，来预测未来波动性资产的发展趋势。
因此，交易者提出 


\subsection{Problem Statement}
根据我们的理解，问题主要有以下几个要点：According to our understanding,our problem has few key points:
\begin{enumerate}    %有序列表 
  \item 用原始数据建立一个模型，分析黄金和比特币价值走向Build a model with raw data to analyze the trend of gold and bitcoin values are going.
  \item 基于时间序列模型，预测未来波动性资产的走势Forecasting future volatile asset movements based on time series models.
  \item 解决利用动态规划实现利益最大化问题,同时兼顾风险Solving the problem of maximizing benefits using dynamic planning while taking risks into account.
  \item 确定交易者每天的交易决策以及交易行为，在有交易佣金的背景下Determine the trader's daily trading decisions and trading behavior with trading commissions.
  \item 证明我们提供了最优策略Prove that we provide the optimal strategy.
  \item Determine how sensitive the strategy is to transaction costs.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Problem Analysis}
After clarifying the problem, we believe that the ARIMA model has a great advantage over the traditional model in the problem of time series analysis.
\textbf{Our work overview}
\begin{itemize}    %无序列表
  \item \textbf{We pre-process the raw data},including filtering the data, visualizing the data, and mining the time series.
  
  This part of the work can greatly improve the efficiency of modeling and analyzing volatile assets.
  \item \textbf{We selected ARIMA for data prediction}
  
  Provided that ARIMA model is applies, we establish daily buy and sell, position transfer and investment ratios to maximize asset value.
  \item \textbf{to prove the optimality of our strategy,}we set perturbation terms on the three criteria developed for buying and selling, position adjustment and portfolio to determine the optimal parameters.
  \item Finally, we enumerate a series of results that \textbf{test the sensitivity to commissions.}
\end{itemize}
明确问题后，我们的认为ARIMA模型在时间序列分析问题上较传统模型有很大优势，
工作概览如下：
首先，我们对原始数据进行了预处理，包括对数据的筛选、使数据可视化、挖掘出时间序列。
这部分的工作可以极大提高建模的效率和分析波动性资产的效率。
接着，由于在时间序列分析问题上ARIMA模型较传统模型的优势，在适用条件下我们选择ARIMA进行数据预测。
以实现资产价值最大化为目的，制定了每日买卖、调仓及投资比例。
然后，为了证明我们的策略最优，我们对制定的买卖、调仓和投资组合三个标准设置了扰动项，来确定的最佳参数。
最后，我们枚举得到的一系列结果检验了对佣金的敏感性。


\section{Assumption}
\begin{enumerate}    %有序列表  
  \item All cash is consumed at each purchase.

  \item The price fluctuations of gold and bitcoin are independent.
\end{enumerate}



\section{Data Processing}
对于我们要解决的数据分析问题，数据的平稳性是我们的模型的基础。
通常来说，原始数据中的不完整和异常数据可能会大大影响我们问题的分析效率和结果准确性。
故，对数据的分析、预先处理是必不可少。
For the problem we faced, 
the stability of the data is the basis of our model.
Generally speaking, incomplete and abnormal data in the raw data may greatly affect the efficiency of problem analysis and the accuracy of the results.
For this reason, it is essential to analyze and pre-process the data.

\subsection{Data Screening}
We analyzed the raw data in the LBMA-GOLD.csv and BCHAIN-MKPRU.csv files,final data status is as follows:

\begin{table}[]
  \begin{tabular}{ccc}
               & gold    & bitcoin  \\
  count        & 1255    & 1826     \\
  mean         & 1464.54 & 12206.06 \\
  std          & 249.29  & 14043.89 \\
  min          & 1125.7  & 594.08   \\
  max          & 2067.15 & 11084.73 \\
  missing data & 10      & 0       
  \end{tabular}
  \end{table}
%插入图片
For the missing data in LBMA-GOLD.csv, we fill in the date according to the average of the day before and the day after.


\subsection{Data Visualization}
To observe the price trends of gold and bitcoin more visually,
we visualize the given data and draw figure\ref{fig1}and\ref{fig2}
\begin{figure}[h]
  %\small
  \centering
  \subfigure[1]{
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth]{D:/meisai/ms/fig/gold.eps}}

  \subfigure[2]{
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\columnwidth]{D:/meisai/ms/fig/Bitcoin.eps}}
  \caption{Bitcoin price tendency} \label{fig2}
  \end{figure}


\subsection{Mining Time Series}
For subsequent data prediction using the time series model ARIMA,
We perform stability test and white noise test on the raw data and processed data as a way to mine meaningful time series.


\subsubsection{Stability Test}
First,we test the stability of the original data by comparing two methods, the image observation and the unit root test.
\begin{figure}[!hb]
  \centering 
  \includegraphics[height=2.75in]{D:/meisai/ms/fig/fig3G.eps}
  \includegraphics[height=2.75in]{D:/meisai/ms/fig/fig3b.eps}
  \caption{Raw data visualization} \label{fig3}
\end{figure}
Testing unit root，and result is shown below:
Gold：Dickey-Fuller = -2.4368, Lag order = 10, p-value = 0.3934<0.1
Bitcoin：Dickey-Fuller = -1.4395, Lag order = 12, p-value = 0.8156<0.1

The raw data, the image mean varies with time and the unit root test p>0.05, so it is an unstable time series.
We then perform first order differencing on the original data to obtain updated data.


%yijiechafen
Secondly,the first-order difference data is obtained according to the first-order difference of the original data, 
and the two methods abrove are also used to test.The result is as follows.\ref{fig4}
Visualizing the first order difference data is illustrated in Figure 4
\begin{figure}[!hb]
  \centering 
  \includegraphics[height=2.75in]{D:/meisai/ms/fig/gd1.eps}
  \includegraphics[height=2.75in]{D:/meisai/ms/fig/bd1.eps}
  \caption{first order difference data} \label{fig4}
\end{figure}

Testing unit root，and result is shown below:

Gold：Dickey-Fuller = -11.357, Lag order = 10, p-value <0.01
Bitcoin：Dickey-Fuller = -11.633, Lag order = 12, p-value <0.01

It can be concluded that the first-order difference data, with image mean essentially zero and unit root test p<0.05, is a stable time series.


%二阶
Thirdly,utilizing second order difference we obtained second order difference data with two methods testing
The result is shown in\ref{fig5}.
\begin{figure}[!h]
  \centering 
  \includegraphics[height=2.75in]{D:/meisai/ms/fig/gd2.eps}
  \includegraphics[height=2.75in]{D:/meisai/ms/fig/bd2.eps}
  \caption{second order difference data} \label{fig5}
\end{figure}

Testing unit root，and result is shown below:

Gold：Dickey-Fuller = -20.351, Lag order = 10, p-value <0.01
Bitcoin：Dickey-Fuller = -18.999, Lag order = 12, p-value <0.01

It can be seen that the image mean of the second order difference data is basically 0 and the unit root test p<0.05, which means it is a stable time series.

\textbf{Final conclusion:} we cannot use the original data directly for time series modeling because it is unstable, and need to use its first-order difference or second-order difference data for time series model.


%白噪音检验
\subsubsection{White Noise Test}
We need to evaluate whether the data is white noise or not, 
and will discard the one that is white noise because it has no research significance.
So We chose Ljung-Box test to meet the demands.

The first step is to examine the raw data,The test yielded the following graph

Gold：X-squared = 7495.2, df = 6, p-value < 2.2e-16
X-squared = 14834, df = 12, p-value < 2.2e-16
X-squared = 22018, df = 18, p-value < 2.2e-16
Bitcoin：X-squared = 10716, df = 6, p-value < 2.2e-16
X-squared = 20966, df = 12, p-value < 2.2e-16
X-squared = 30765, df = 18, p-value < 2.2e-16

Raw data p<0.05, not white noise

The second step,we test first order difference data,result can be seen below:

Gold：X-squared = 35.268, df = 6, p-value = 3.824e-06
X-squared = 47.324, df = 12, p-value = 4.097e-06
X-squared = 56.106, df = 18, p-value = 8.576e-06
Bitcoin：X-squared = 21.896, df = 6, p-value = 0.001265
X-squared = 63.942, df = 12, p-value = 4.275e-09
X-squared = 71.685, df = 18, p-value = 2.339e-08

First order differential data p<0.05, not white noise

Third,we test second order difference data,result is shown below

Second-order differential data p<0.05, not white noise
\textbf{Final conclusion: }
The data come from a professional data statistics center and should not be white noise, and the test results prove it. They are not white noise.

\section{PartⅠ：Model Development }
\subsection{Time Series Model ARIMA - Data Forecasting }
\subsubsection{Model Theory}
Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model is the differential integrated moving average autoregressive model, 
also known as the integrated moving(or slilding)average autoregressive model, 
is one of the time series forecasting analysis methods. 
In ARIMA(p, d, q),AR is "autoregressive", p is the number of autoregressive terms;
MA is "sliding average ",q is the number of sliding average terms, and d is the number of differences (order) made to make it a smooth series.
Although the word "difference" does not appear in the English name of ARIMA, it is a key step to analyse time series.

\subsubsection{Determining the parameters p, q }
We take advantage of the autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation plots to find out the parameters p, q.
The following figures show the the format of autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation plots.
\begin{figure}[!h]
  \centering 
  \includegraphics[height=2.75in]{D:/meisai/ms/fig/g6.eps}
  \caption{Autocorrelation diagram}
  \includegraphics[height=2.75in]{D:/meisai/ms/fig/b6.eps}
  \caption{Partial autocorrelation diagram} \label{fig6}
\end{figure}

In theory
Tail-dragging: always have non-zero values, not constant equal to zero after k is greater than some constant (or fluctuate randomly around 0).

Truncated tail: After greater than a constant k, it quickly tends to 0 as a k-order truncated tail when both autocorrelation and partial.

By figure \ref{fig4}and \ref{fig5}, it can be seen that the first order difference data and the second order difference data are meaningful time series.
Therefore,we use the same methods in the subsequent section.The analysis charts are as follows.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\end{figure}


%R语言确定
\subsubsection{R Language Determines the Optimal Parameters p, d, q}
Given that only the price data as of the day can be used each day, i.e., 
the training data used each day are inconsistent,
it is not practical to determine the optimal parameters for the model through autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation plots, 
so we use the auto.arima function in R language to automate the parameter determination.

The best model information was obtained after using the auto.arima function with all given data.
And the model is as follows:
Gold:p=4，d=1，q=5;ARIMA(4,1,5)                          Bitcoin:p=2，d=1，q=1;ARIMA(2,1,1) 

%模型残差白噪声检验
\subsubsection{White noise test for model residuals}
It is usually assumed that the model residuals of a reasonable model should be white noise.
logically we conducted a white noise test on the residuals of the resulting model.
The results are as follows.

Gold：X-squared = 4.9084, df = 7.1428, p-value = 0.6862
Bitcoin：X-squared = 1.3484, df = 7.5099, p-value = 0.9919
We can see model residuals p>0.05, is white noise.Our model is valid.


\subsubsection{Model Prediction and Visualization}
To make the results more intuitive,we use the model to calculate and predict the historical data. 
And the visualization results are shown in the figure
%chatu

The reason for the large overlap of lines in Figure 6 is that the data sample is too large.
So we choose 100 of these samples and make graph7.
%插图
The model fits well apparently from the images.


\subsubsection{Batch prediction of data}   %去未来七天
Based on the price data as of the day,we predicted gold and bitcoin price for the next 7 days 
and the same automated arima modeling is performed using the auto.arima function to obtain the price data for the next 7 days.
By analyzing the forecast data, we observed a roughly linear variation. 
Then,we integrated these data using linear regression to clarity the future price trend 
and fitted slope quantifies the trend to make the better investment decisions.

%流程图


\subsubsection{Expected return on assets}
Traders pay a percentage of commission when they buy and sell assets, in other words, there is hidden cost to holding assets every day.
We use$\alpha \div T$ to represent such costs.
当购买和卖出资产时需要支付一定比例的佣金，换句话说，每天持有资产是有成本的，可以用%$\alpha \div T$表示。

We determine trading behavior by comparing the expected benefit with the size of that cost.
When expected revenue is large enough to offset this cost,model decide to buy;
When the expected return is less than the negative cost, it represents maintaining;
When the asset is about to lose more than commission cost,model needs to sold Holding share immediately to stop loss.
当预期收益大到足以抵消这个成本时，就可以考虑买入。当预期收益小于负的成本时，代表持有
该资产的亏损额即将超过成本，需要立刻抛出止损。

If如果$r>(1+\beta )\alpha \div T$，代表该资产近期会涨，可以买入。it means that the asset will appreciation in the future,so trader can be buy in.

If如果$r<-(1-\beta )\alpha \div T$，代表该资产近期会跌，必须卖出。it represents that the asset will depreciation in upcoming period,so trader must sell them out .

If如果$-(1-\beta )\alpha \div T<r<(1+\beta )\alpha \div T$,代表资产近期价格稳定，不需要买也不需要卖。it indicates that recent prices are stable,trader can either buy or sell.


moreover,由于投资者、投资产品的不同，due to the difference in investors and investment products,
投资方对于风险有不同的厌恶程度，因此我们引入了来刻画风险厌恶程度。We introduce$\beta $ to characterize the diffrent degree of risk aversion.

%$\beta $越大，表示投资者越保守，买入的限制更严格，卖出的限制更宽松。
反之，表示投资者越激进，他有更宽松的买入标准和更严格的卖出标准。
The larger the $\beta $,refers to the more conservative the investors is,stricter restrictions on buying and more lenient restrictions on selling.
On the contrary,thr smaller $\beta $ indicates that the more aggressive the investor is, who has more lenient buying criteria and more stringent selling criteria.


Additionally,we have to consider the following two situations when purchasing:
此外,在购买时我们不得不考虑下面两种情况：
\begin{enumerate}
  \item 如果黄金和比特币中只有一种达到了上涨条件，那么我们只需要把当前的可用资金全部买入该资产即可。If only one of gold and bitcoin meets the upside condition, then we simply buy all of our currently available funds into that asset.
  \item 而如果黄金和比特币同时上涨，就需要考虑如何分配可用资金。在这种情况下，我们采用夏普比率衡量不同比例投资组
  合的好坏程度。Whereas if gold and bitcoin rise at the same time,there is a need to consider how to allocate the available funds. 
  In this case, we use the Sharpe ratio to measure the different proportional investment groups

  $$ Sharpe \; Ratio=\frac{w_G\times r_G+w_B\times r_B}{\sqrt{w_G^2 \sigma _G^2 + w_B^2 \sigma _B^2+2Cov_{w_B w_G}}}$$
  我们用下半标准差作为衡量风险的量化指标，作为标准差中代表小于均值的波动的部分，它更能体现资产亏损的风险。
We use the lower semi-variance as a quantitative index of risk, as the portion of the standard deviation that represents fluctuations less than the mean.
which is more indicative of the risk of asset losses.
  用预期收益率除下半标准差得到夏普比率，它意味着当前投资组合每一单位风险所对应的收益大小。
We divide the expected return by the following half standard deviation yields the Sharpe ratio,which implies the magnitude of the return per unit of risk of the current portfolio.
  当夏普比率最大时，无疑意味着当前比例的投资组合是最优的。
When the Sharpe ratio is maximum, it undoubtedly means that the current proportion of the portfolio is optimal

  根据“每次购买时消耗所有现金”和“黄金和比特币的价格波动相互独立”这两个假设，求解最优的投资比例可以简化为如下的一个优化问题，我们可以利用计算机求出它的数值解。
Based on the assumptions that "All cash is consumed at each purchase" and "The price fluctuations of gold and bitcoin are independent", 
We simplify the problem of solving the optimal investment ratio as an optimization problem.
And we can use the computer to find its numerical solution.

\begin{align*}
  max \qquad & \frac{w_G\times r_G+w_B\times r_B}{\sqrt{w_G^2 \sigma _G^2 + w_B^2 \sigma _B^2}}\\
  s.t. \quad & w_G+w_B=1\\
  & 0 \le w_G \le 1 \\
\end{align*}
\end{enumerate}


\subsubsection{当前的资产持有情况Current Asset Holding}
在确定完资产的收益情况之后，我们还必须考虑当前的资产配置情况，才能确定最终购买何种资产、卖出何种资产。
After determining the return on the assets, we also consider the current asset allocation in order to determine what and how much assets we will eventually buy or sell.
根据“每次购买时消耗所有现金”的假设，我们不可能同时持有现金、黄金、比特币，也不可能同时不持有任何资产。
With the assumption that "All cash is consumed at each purchase",it is impossible to hold cash, gold, bitcoin or no assets at the same time.
因此一共有%$2^3-2=6$种可能的情况，分别是：(实心圆表示持有该资产，空心圆表示不持有该资产)
So there are a total of $2^3-2=6$ possible scenarios, to be specific: (solid circles indicate that the asset is held, hollow circles indicate that the asset is not held)

\begin{tabular}{c c c}
  \hline
  cash&gold&bitcoin\\
  \hline
  \hline
  $\bullet$ & $\circ$  &  $\circ$\\
  \hline
  $\bullet$ & $\circ$  &  $\bullet $\\
  \hline
  $\bullet$ & $\bullet $  &  $\circ  $\\
  \hline
  $\circ $ & $\circ$  &  $\bullet $\\
  \hline
  $\circ $ & $\bullet $  &  $\circ  $\\
  \hline
  $\circ $ & $\bullet $  &  $\bullet   $\\
  \hline
  \end{tabular}


\subsubsection{Determination of the final act of transaction}
每天的黄金和比特币的预期收益都有上涨、下跌、稳定三种情况，Daily expected returns for gold and bitcoin are up, down, and stable.
当他们组合在一起时共有9种情况。So,there are 9 cases when they are combined together.
而每天资产的初始状态，正如上一小节所指出的，有6种情况。And the initial state of the daily assets, as pointed out in the previous subsection, has six profiles.
因此，最终的交易行为有54种情况。Thus, the final trading behavior totals 54 scenarios.
幸运的是，这54种情况可以被下面的6种情况概括：Fortunately, we can summarize this into the following six situations:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{one maintain,the other appreciate:}In this case, if cash is available trader uses it all to buy appreciating assets. If no cash is available do not make the purchase.
  在这种情况下，如果有现金就用现金全部买入升值的资产。如果没有现金就不进行购买
  \item \textbf{one maintain,the other depreciate:}Under such circumstances, trader sells all the devalued asset if they hold.
  在这种情况下，如果持有该贬值资产的话就全额卖出
  \item \textbf{one appreciate,the other depreciate:}In this case, the trader first sells the depreciating asset in full and then buys the appreciating asset with all the cash gained.
  在这种情况下，首先全额卖出贬值资产，然后将获得的全部现金买入升值资产
  \item \textbf{both maintain:}Trader does not make any transactions
  不进行任何交易
    \item \textbf{both appreciate:}
  如4.2.1种所说，两个资产的预期收益同时上涨时，需要根据夏普比率确定最优的资产组合。
  As mentioned in 4.2.1, when the expected returns of two assets rise simultaneously, we need to determine the optimal asset mix based on the Sharpe ratio.
  如果此时只持有现金一种资产，那么我们可以直接根据最优比例购买两种资产。If we only hold cash as an asset, then we can simply buy two assets based on the optimal ratio.
  而如果此时持有黄金、比特币中的任何一种或者同时持有两种时，我们就要决定是否还需要将比例调整为最优比例，毕竟每次调整都需要不少佣金。
  However, if we hold either gold, bitcoin or both, we have to decide if we still need to adjust the ratio to the optimal ratio.After all, each adjustment requires a significant commission.
  为了简化模型，我们根据经验给出了调仓的标准：如果调仓时两种资产同时变动的比例超过百分之10，就调整为最优比例，否则就保持不变To simplify the model, we define the criteria for transferring positions:
  If the proportion of simultaneous changes in both assets exceeds 10 percent when the position is transferred, it will be adjusted to the optimal proportion, otherwise it will remain unchanged.
  
  \item\textbf{both depreciate:}After selling two assets at the same time, we only have one asset in cash
  同时卖出两种资产，这之后我们只拥有现金一种资产
\end{enumerate}

  \item 卖出标准除了预期收益

\section{PartⅡ:Strategy Evaluation}
\subsection{Set Perturbation Terms }%to determine optimal parameters }
To demonstrate strategy optimality,firstly we add small perturbations to the buy and sell criteria.

Then,we make minor adjustments to the buy and sell criteria, invoking the model (at this point the risk appetite indicator is 0.2) to calculate the final asset size,.

Finally，observe the asset stability.We found In the range of -0.25 to 0.25, the final asset is basically smooth and there is no sudden drop, which shows that the model stability is relatively reliable.
result shown in the figure.

\section{PartⅢ:Sensitivity Analysis}
\subsection{Assuming Changes In Commission}
We set the commission percentage of gold as a, the commission percentage of bitcoin as b, and the final asset as f USD. 
After we kept adjusting the commission rate, we obtained the final assets under different commission rates, and the results are shown in the figure.%ref

\textbf{Final conclusion}
Both the gold commission ratio a and the bitcoin commission ratio b will significantly affect the final asset f dollars when they changes.
According to the analysis,f is essentially negatively correlated with b and f will be more sensitive to changes in b compared to a.
Our model is not very good at grasping the price of gold because it changes so frequently.
So it is not true that if the transaction cost is low, trader will benefit more.
But for bitcoin, the changes are large and infrequent, the model is easier to make a correct judgment, and when the transaction cost is very low or even 0, we can arbitrage and protect the value easily.

In summary, it can be seen that the model is sensitive to trading commissions.


\section{Evaluate of the Model}
\subsection{Strengths and weaknesses}
\textbf{Strengths}
\begin{enumerate}    %有序列表 
  \item By using the time series model ARIMA to forecast the data, the prediction is effective and can be applied as a future price reference for decision making.
  \item Our trade model extends the generalizability of the model by fully considering return and risk factors and introducing risk appetite indicators.
  \item The model is more stable than the conventional model, and the variation of the model results is small for minor perturbations.
  \item The model grasp bitcoin price fluctuations well, for fully capturing the ups and downs of bitcoin.
  and with traders only having historical data from before that day, the final asset can reach around 20,000USD, which is already very impressive.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Weaknesses}
\begin{enumerate}    %有序列表 
  \item The model forecast of gold changes needs to be improved and the profitability level is relatively low.
  \item The model performs well when the risk appetite indicator is 0.05-0.45 and can be considered an average risk taker, but otherwise the model underperforms.
\end{enumerate}
