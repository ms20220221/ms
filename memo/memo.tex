\maketitle 
Dear Traders,

   It's a great pleasure to have a connection with you the other day,when we had a constructive discussion on prospect of 
your investment.In order to maximize your interests,we built a model to meet your investment need.
   
   Having made some suverys on investment in Bitcoin and Gold,
we found it is difficult to accurately predict the movements.
So we employed ARIMA model for the problem.I have summarized the key points of how our model was built:

\begin{enumerate}    %有序列表
    \item Time series model ARIMA predicts future seven-day data
    
    \item The future price trend is obtained by linearly fitting the data for the next seven days and quantified by the slope k.
    
    \item Determine the trading commission ratios a and b, risk appetite indicators, etc. based on the slope k. 
    
    and specify buy criteria, sell criteria and position adjustment standard.

    \item Determine the daily trading strategy based on each criterion and perform simulation trading to calculate the final asset.

\end{enumerate}

   After testing,we can make sure our model is very reliable. In addition,simulation results prove that the model can achieve quite objective profitability.

Every trader can operate our model at their disposal,because it only needs historical price data and does not require any additional data to work.
You no longer need to be tormented by obsessing about how to trade every day.Our model will tell you exactly what to do with your daily investments,
including guidance on whether to buy or sell assets and what percentage of gold and bitcoin to buy.
It is profitable for you to arbitrage and preserve value.

   In brief, the advantages of our model are as follows:
   \begin{enumerate}    %有序列表 
    \item By using the time series model ARIMA to forecast the data, the prediction is effective and can be applied as a future price reference for decision making.
    
    \item Our trade model extends the generalizability of the model by fully considering return and risk factors and introducing risk appetite indicators.
    
    \item The model is more stable than the conventional model, and the variation of the model results is small for minor perturbations.
    
    \item The model grasp bitcoin price fluctuations well, for fully capturing the ups and downs of bitcoin.
    
  \end{enumerate}

    Every coin has two sides,and our model is no exception.
    \textbf{Weaknesses}
\begin{enumerate}    %有序列表 
  \item The model forecast of gold changes needs to be improved and the profitability level is relatively low.
  
  \item The model performs well when the risk appetite indicator is 0.05-0.45 and can be considered an average risk taker, but otherwise the model underperforms.
   
    According to different risk aversion for each individual,you may get different investment results.You can see the results visually in the table below.

    To sum up,you can profit more at the expense of stability of your investment.
And you need to be aware that our predictions are not necessarily accurate,no conclusion should be drawn before the real price is announced.
    
     Best wishes!

                                                                                                                                     Your Sincerely,
                                                                                                                                     Team 2227906
